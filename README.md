# Welcome! This is my Harvard CSCI-S-33A course repo. 

Here I will have all projects, from 0 to 3 and the final project as well. I will also leave some tests and codes I've written during the course.

## Project 0

In project0 directory you can find a simple website, developed using the concepts from Classes 0 and 1 - HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap framework. Please access https://gbrandao-creator.github.io/CSCI-S-33a/project0/final/index.html to take a look!
